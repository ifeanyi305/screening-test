## Introduction

The Mathematical and Chemistry Tools is a collection of small applications that solve mathematical and chemistry problems. It provides solutions for problems related to dilution calculations, factor pairs, ring combinations, and number classifications. The tools are built using JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS for the front end.

### Features

- **Hashard Number checker:** The Harshad Number Checker allows users to check whether a given number is a Harshad number. A Harshad number, also known as a Niven number, is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits.

- **Dilution Calculator:** Allows users to calculate the amount of dilution required to achieve the recommended concentration in a solution.

- **Factor Pairs Generator:** Generates factor pairs for a given number, useful for mathematical problem-solving.

- **Ring Combinations:** Calculates all possible combinations of rings following certain constraints, such as identical rings and interchangeable rings.

- **Number Classification:** Determines whether a given number is a Harshad number or not, where a Harshad number is divisible by the sum of its digits.

## Coding Challenges

### Dilution Calculator (`calculateDilutionReplacement`)

A program that calculates how many milliliters of a liquid (e.g., syrup) need to be replaced with water or the liquid itself to achieve a recommended dilution as indicated on the bottle.

### Ring Combinations (`getRingCombinations`)

A program that generates all possible combinations of rings based on certain constraints, such as interchangeable rings and wearing rings on one or both hands.

### Number Classification (`isHarshadNumber`)

A program that checks if a given number is a Harshad number, which is an integer divisible by the sum of its digits.

### Factor Pairs Generator (`findFactorPairs`)

A program that finds all factor pairs of a given number, useful for mathematical problem-solving.
